,tumor sphere 3541 or 21238 engrafted on 3/11/2019;
,5 pups from this litter had colored tails that were cleaned off by female so the pup could be engrafted by 3541 or 21238;
,"During necropsy, this mice had enlarged brains which corresponds with 3/5 pups that were engrafted 3541, therefore it is very good chance that this mouse was grafted with 3541"
,"A piece of brain was collected to start tumor sphere culture, the rest was fixed for IHC."
