Additional comments,"This mouse was sac'd as a 0 hr dox time point. Upon being placed in the sac cage (prior to being exposed to CO2), it appeared to have difficulty breathing. During necropsy, there appeared to be blood pooling underneath the skull prior to any cuts being made. The mouse and brain appeared normal otherwise."
