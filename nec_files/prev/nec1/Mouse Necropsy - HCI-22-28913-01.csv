Additional comments,"Brain was large and soft. No primary tumor was found at base of skull, though that was likely just the swollen brain pressing on the skull. Upon opening the chest cavity, many tumors were found (4-5 tumors much larger than the heart). This was similarly seen on mouse 28914 which was found dead and in rigor mortis but was opened to investigate. Sheri mentioned this may be mycoplasma contamination.",,
