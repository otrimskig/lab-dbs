Additional comments,"mouse was found with limited hind leg mobility on 6/1. Sacked before the weekend since it appeared like it was moving less and could have starved or dehydrated, no primary tumor observed, spine looked normal, brain and lung were fixed. Possible that leg mobility issue was not tumor related.",,
