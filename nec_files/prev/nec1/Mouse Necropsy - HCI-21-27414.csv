Additional comments,"Mouse had what looked like a bump on the back of its head and began to loose weight and move around less, looks like hydrocephalus because nothing was observed outside of the skull, but the skull was expanded. There was a little bit of mushy tissue inside the skull, so it was used to try and start a cell line, but there is likely no tumor",,
